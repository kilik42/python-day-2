# # Description: This file is for the second day of the python workshop


# # create variables for the following :
# # 1. age
# # 2. name
# # 3. song
# # 4. food
# # 5. number
# # #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# # Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
# # [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would
# # throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
# # Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day.
# # Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?
# # No one will ever know.


# # What is syntax ? What is an algorithm?
# # what is a variable? What is a string?

# # strings are nothing but plain text
# # what does this do?
# from os import name


# print("Giraffe \n academy")

# # or this
# phrase = "python learning"
# print(phrase + "is cool")
# #what does the + sign do? What is it called?


# #what if I wanted to get the length of a phrase?


#what if I wanted to make the letters in the variable upper case or lower?
name = "welcome to day 2 part 3"
print(f'the length is {len(name)}')
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())


#what if I wanted to check and see if the phrase was all lower or upper?
print(name.islower())#returns a boolean true or false
print(name.isupper())#returns a boolean true or false

#What if I wanted to get one letter of the phrase
phrase2 = "fallout is a great show"
print(phrase2[0])#prints the first letter of the string
print(phrase2[1])
print(phrase2[5])# prints the 6th letter of the string
print(phrase2[13])#prints the index of the first occurence of the letter a
#string slicing if I wanted to get
#entire word
print(phrase2[13:18])#prints the first 7 letters of the string
print(phrase2[19:23])#prints the first 7 letters of the string
#fallout
print(phrase2[0:7])#prints the index of the first occurence of the letter a
#get the last letter of the string
print(phrase2[-1])#prints the last letter of the string

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase
# letter eye) as single character variable names.



# Working with numbers 
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Addition
print(2 + 2)
# Subtraction
print(2 - 5)
# Multiplication
print(2 * 3)
# Division
print(10 / 2)
# Modulus
print(10 % 3)#prints the remainder of the division
# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)# 2 to the power of 3
# Floor Division
print(10 // 3)# 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1
# Order of Operations followed in Python
print(2 * 3 + 1)# 7
# You can use parentheses to specify the order in which you want operations to be performed.

#to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
#from math import *
#this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
#floor method
#ceil method
#sqrt method
from math import * #import everything
print(floor(95.76666))
print(ceil(98.3333))
print(sqrt(54))


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers. Integers are just whole numbers,
# positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or
# use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of
# floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating
# point number in Python.



# challenge exerces... 
#create a program that asks for the user's name and age and then prints out the user's name and age

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all caps

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all lower case

# create a program that asks for price and then prints out the price with a 10% discount

# Given the phrase "Hancock High School", perform the following operations:
# Print the phrase with a newline character to separate "Hancock" and "High" and "School".
# Concatenate the phrase with " is cool", and print the result.
# Print the length of the phrase.
# Convert and print the phrase in uppercase and lowercase.
# Check if the phrase is all lower or all upper and print the result.
# Print the first and the last letter of the phrase.
